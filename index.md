<!-- ## AI in Robotics Reading Group -->

AI in Robotics Reading group is organized by the Faculty and Students at the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/), [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) for students across the world to present and interact with the Toronto Robotics Community.

**Format**: Opportunities for students to persent their research and get opportunities to connect with peers from other institutions are inceasingly getting rare. This phenomenon is sped up by low rate of oral/spotlights at top AI meetings and all events going online. This series aims to create opportunities for students to present their work in a friendly setting and get feedback and hopefully build new collaborations and network. 

- As a guiding principle, all speakers in these talks are first authors or co-authors intimately familiar with the work to field questions at every level of detail.   
- Unlike job talks, we usually prefer that speakers focus on a couple of main papers/ideas rather than present a full arc of their recent work.  
- Usually talks range from 30-35 mins (rarely going upto 45 mins), with the remaining time for Q&A and discussions. 


### Logistics 

We meet from 1030 to 1130 EST on Fridays. [See in other time zones](https://savvytime.com/converter/canada-toronto-to-ca-san-francisco-united-kingdom-london-india-bengaluru-china-beijing-japan-tokyo-australia-sydney/aug-28-2020/10-30am)  
The meetings will be hosted on youtube with hosts/presenters using zoom.
