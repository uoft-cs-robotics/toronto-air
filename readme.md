# Notes on invited speakers and logistics

- We send out an email to the invited speaker with potential dates for their presentation (Animesh does this now). The Google sheet with the list of presentations is at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EhflDioP8X46klAMUNbk579b-ox7iWc33WUerr2DSwU/edit#gid=169934371). 
- After the speaker replies with a date, we follow-up with three questions: 1) Is it alright if we record their talk? 2) If yes, then is it alright if we post their recording in [this publicly accessible page](https://www.pair.toronto.edu/robotics-rg/) 3) Will they be available for 1-1 meetings after the talk from 1130 EST to 1230 EST
- Two days before their presentation, we send them the zoom link for the talk from 1030 EST to 1130 EST and tell them that people are still signing up for 1-1 meetings.
- We post [this signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hV5MwBBMbIWXxgHIQvyfgJcTDLSrcenvRBwkHAOC-6w/edit#gid=0) in the UTCS-Robotics slack and ask people to sign-up to meet the speaker (we edit the sheet to reflect the current speaker's name and date of their virtual visit).
- We publicize the talk (not the 1-1 meetings) on Vector slack and UofT Robotics Institute slack. The 1-1 meetings are for folks within the UTCS-Robotics group only.
- On the day of the talk we e-mail the signup sheet with 1-1 meetings to the speaker. It also contains the google hangouts link that will be used for the meetings.
- We remember to hit record on zoom while the talk starts, and introduce the speaker in the beginning. We upload the recording on youtube soon after and link it to this repo (the RG website).
- We email the speaker thanking them for visiting us, and asking if they would like to share their slides with us too - we link the slides in the website.
